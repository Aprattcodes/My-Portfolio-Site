        <h2>Creative Me</h2>
        <p>I have been practicing art for as long as I can remember. I really started developing my craft in high school, where I first took up painting. I was told by many that I should pursue my talents, but others who didn't understand the value of being an artist steered me in a different direction. I suffered through my first two years of college thinking I was going to be a med-student. I finally broke down and changed my degree. I ended up with a dual BA in Art History and Art Practices. I still think I was one of the best decisions of my life. It taught me to strive toward creativity and to always have an open mind. To always experiment with different mediums, which is what led me to the digital world. I have always loved computers and I have always loved being an artist. Putting those together bring me to a new journey towards becoming a Web Developer and Designer.</p>
