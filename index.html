    <h1>My Name Is Alyssa Pratt</h1>
    <p>I graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder in 2016. I have my BA with majors in Art History and Art Practices. After I graduated, I knew I wanted a creative direction in my life. It took some searching and self-realization, but I came across a potential career in web development. I fell in love with the idea of this being a career and have been practicing my coding skills ever since!
